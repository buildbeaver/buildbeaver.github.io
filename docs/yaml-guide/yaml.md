# Why So Simple?

BuildBeaver has a simple YAML syntax that covers jobs, steps, services and artifacts.

We believe that more complex requirements like Matrix Builds, conditional jobs and other
programming-language-like structures are better expressed using the loops, if statements
and other constructs of a 'real' (procedural) programming language, so the YAML syntax covers just the basics.
