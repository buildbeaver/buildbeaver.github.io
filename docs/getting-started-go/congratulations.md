# Congratulations!

You have just learned the **basics of creating a Go Dynamic Build**.

We'd love to hear what you think of BuildBeaver! If you like it, or there are things you feel are
missing or needed, please [Contact us!](https://github.com/buildbeaver/buildbeaver/issues)!

## What's next?

- To find out more about the powerful features of the Dynamic Builds using the BuildBeaver SDK, and for a
  real-world Go example, see the **[Guide to Dynamic Builds](../category/guide-to-dynamic-builds)**.

- If you don't need the power of dynamic builds and are interested in using YAML to define your builds,
see the  **[YAML Guide](../category/yaml-guide)**.

- To run BuildBeaver using GitHub actions, see the **[GitHub Actions Tutorial](../category/github-actions)**.
