# Installation

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed on your development machine:

- **Git**: Ensure the Git command-line tool is installed on your development machine.

- **Docker**: For this tutorial the build will run within a Docker container, so
  [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) must be installed on your development machine. Docker Hub must be accessible in order
  to pull public docker images.

## Install BuildBeaver

Download the **BuildBeaver command-line tool** executable for either
[Mac (Intel)](https://github.com/buildbeaver/bb-cli/releases/download/v1.0.0/bb_1.0.0_osx_x64.zip),
[Mac (arm)](https://github.com/buildbeaver/bb-cli/releases/download/v1.0.0/bb_1.0.0_osx_arm64.zip),
[Linux](https://github.com/buildbeaver/bb-cli/releases/download/v1.0.0/bb_1.0.0_linux_x64.zip) or
[Windows](https://github.com/buildbeaver/bb-cli/releases/download/v1.0.0/bb_1.0.0_win_x64.zip).

Extract the ``bb`` tool from the archive and add it to your path.

The BuildBeaver command line tool is open source, so you have the option to compile it yourself from the GitHub repo.
