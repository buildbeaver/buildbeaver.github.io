# Installation

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed on your development machine:

- **Git**: Ensure the Git command-line tool is installed on your development machine.

- **Docker**: For this tutorial the build to run within a Docker container, so
  [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) must be installed on your development machine. Docker Hub must be accessible in order
  to pull public docker images.

- **Golang** (recommended): If you want to use Golang rather than YAML to define your build (recommended)
  then we recommend installing [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install) version 1.17 or greater on your
  development machine.

## BuildBeaver

Download the **BuildBeaver command-line tool** executable for either [Mac](https://github.com/buildbeaver/bb-cli),
[Windows](https://github.com/buildbeaver/bb-cli) or 
[Linux](https://github.com/buildbeaver/bb-cli), 
and add the executable to your path.

The BuildBeaver command line tool is open source, so you have the option to compile it yourself from the GitHub repo.
